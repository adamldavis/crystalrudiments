At the start of the program, there is nothing but space. The
					user can create planets with specific trajectories, sizes, and
					velocities by clicking and dragging with the mouse.  The left
					mouse key and right mouse key produce different sized planets. 
					By selecting a planet, it becomes the center of view, so that it
					always stays in the exact center of the screen.</P>
					<P>The program has options for saving, loading, and starting a
					new session. All of the internal components of the program are,
					of course, reusable, so you can adapt them for your application.
