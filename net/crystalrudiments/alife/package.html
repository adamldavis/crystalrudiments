At the start of the program, the user is shown a collection
of nine different randomly produced images. After each interval,
the user can select any image, preferably the one most pleasing
to him/her. The program then creates another nine images
randomly mutated from the image selected by the user.</P>
<P>The program has options for saving, loading, and starting a
new session. All of the internal components of the program are,
of course, reusable, so you can adapt them for your application.
