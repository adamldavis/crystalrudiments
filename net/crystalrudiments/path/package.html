This library contains an interface for a two-dimensional
					world in which to find a path and an interface for an algorithm
					for finding that path.  It also contains three implementations
					of path finders, two of which are for demonstration, and one of
					which is optimized for speed and efficiency.   The jar file is
					runnable and contains an applet for demonstrating the efficiency
					of the algorithm.</P>
					<P>This library can be plugged into any application, such as an
					RPG game, needing an AI for quickly determining a path through a
					2D block world.
